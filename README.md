# ChatBot

The issue I am addressing is how people could struggle to get the amount of medals south africa have gotten at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Who won the medals and in what sport/event.

steps on how to use:
1. To start the bot please type /start.
2. It will then give this message: "Hi! I can tell you about South Africa's Olympic medals. Use /medals to get the latest info."
3. Press on the /medals to get further instructions.
4. The next message will then show up in the chat "Please type the type of medal you want to see (gold, silver, bronze, or all)."
5. You then type in the chat which medal result you would like to see.
6. If you give it invalid input this message will then be sent: "Invalid input. Please type gold, silver, bronze, or all." (This is also the limitation of the chatbot, if foreign information is asked it will only give the same message.)
